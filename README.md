100 Days of Machine Learning Code Challenge

I hereby accept Siraj Raval's 100 Days of ML Code Challenge! I'd like to thank Siraj for galvanizing the community around such a productive endeavor. I very much look forward to participating in this challenge (video link explaining the challenge here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuQMBj1cWPo).

The Rules:

I pledge to dedicate at least one hour of everyday toward coding and/or studying Machine Learning.

I pledge to write daily articles, to be posted here on Medium, and tweet about my progress (with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag).

When applicable, I will post all relevant code to the repository I created for this purpose on github, located here: https://github.com/lukemshannonhill/100_Days_of_Machine_Learning

At the outset, I thought it would be useful to clarify my interests within the field and the goals I'd like to achieve by engaging with this project.

My Interests

Each of the below links to something relevant - usually a paper or a codebase on the topic. In no particular order, here's a lot of what I'd like to engage more deeply with throughout this challenge:

Deep Learning
Generative Adversarial Networks
Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (which is N.E.A.T.)
Plasticity in Neural Networks
Recurrent Neural Nets
Convolutional Neural Nets
Long Short-Term Memory
Hyperparameter Optimization
Reinforcement Learning
Q-learning
Music Generation
Deep Photo Style Transfer
Time Series Analysis
Bayesian Methods for Machine Learning
World Models
Neural Scene Representation and Rendering
WaveNet
Explore and Better Understand the Intersection of Blockchain and AI 

And, more generally and with a somewhat playful and philosophical bent: clarifying notions of computability and, to the greatest extent possible, demystifying the seemingly prevailing notion of the unknowable "black box" that is the trained set of weights and parameters characterizing trained deep learning models.

My Goals

At the end of this journey I would like to be able to show a rich portfolio of code, analysis, and narrative treating all of the above topics and models plus all of the additional content I'll invariably discover over the course of this learning journey.

I'd also like to be able to explain and demonstrate (at a reasonably granular level) the mathematical machinery underpinning machine learning. To that end, then, I imagine future posts treating topics like, "What's a gradient, anyway?" and, "Backpropagation: Explained." 

Finally - and, I think, most importantly - I'd like to contribute to the plethora of existing resources aimed at encouraging others toward engaging with machine learning. I agree with Siraj when he says, "machine learning is the most transformative and important technology of our time". My aim throughout this process will be to critically engage with freely accessible materials while always being sure to properly cite my sources and provide links.

Next Steps


Stay tuned for my next post, where I'll review  chapter one of Michael Nielson's excellent (and free!) book  Neural Networks and Deep Learning. Michael introduces neural networks and uses them to classify handwritten digits. Sounds like a great start!
