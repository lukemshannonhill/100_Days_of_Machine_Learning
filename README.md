100 Days of Machine Learning Code Challenge

I hereby accept Siraj Raval's 100 Days of ML Code Challenge! I'd like to thank Siraj for galvanizing the community around such a productive endeavor. I very much look forward to participating in this challenge (video link explaining the challenge here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuQMBj1cWPo).

The Rules:

I pledge to dedicate at least one hour of everyday toward coding and/or studying Machine Learning.

I pledge to write daily articles, to be posted here on Medium, and tweet about my progress (with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag).

When applicable, I will post all relevant code to the repository I created for this purpose on github, located here: https://github.com/lukemshannonhill/100_Days_of_Machine_Learning
